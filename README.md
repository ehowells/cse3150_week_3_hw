I used pointers to store names in dynamic memory, then references to those pointers to allow functions to modify variables without returning them. Const was used in methods where the inputs should not be changed, like the names and GPAs in the functions addStudent, printStudent, and averageGPA. I used casting to round the average GPA to an integer, and exceptions to signal errors (like a full or empty list) without the program crashing. Lastly, control flow was used as for loops to iterate through the names and GPAs, if-else statements to check whether conditions for throwing exceptions were met, a switch statement to run the menu, and a do-while loop around the switch to ensure that the menu runs until the user specifies to quit.
